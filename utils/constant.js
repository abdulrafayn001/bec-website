    text: "Business Executive Club has been a platform that brought many new learning aspects and transitioned into my student life bringing new level of responsibility and learnings. Being a member of this club helped me engage in a new social atmosphere and meet a diverse population of people that allowed me to expand my thinking and interests. By working together with my fellow club members helped me unleash such a positive and productive energy. It undoubtedly encouraged my both personal and professional development that boasted my creativity, engagement, productivity, team work, communication, and efficiency. Becoming the president of Business Executive Club allowed me to develop leadership and management skills within an environment of my club members.  I learned so much from my respected patron (Sir Kazim Ali), and fellow club members and this opportunity polished my leadership abilities through planning, implementing different events, and leading my honourable team. My involvement in this prestigious club helped me gain so many organisational and management skills like planning, communication, decision making, delegation, motivation, and leadership skills. I will be forever thankful to this club, my patron, and the club members for being such a productive force in my student life. I highly encourage everyone to join this club if they want to learn numerous professional skills within an executive environment.",
